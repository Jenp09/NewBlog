              </div></div>
            <p>For hundreds of thousands of years, humans began to burn fossil fuels during the industrial revolution. Yet, this activity is harmful not only to public health but also the environment. A number of air pollutants, for example, will be emitted. Sulfur Dioxide, primarily, is the result of burning coal, contributes to acid rain and the formation of noxious particulate matter. </p>
            <p>Not long until around 100 years later in the 1880s, the use of machines began to replace human labour throughout Europe and North America. The automation had greatly increased in production capacity that would affect human needs, including food production, medicine, housing, and clothing. The most conspicuous evidence of the industrial revolution is widespread in human population growth. The fact that the natural and manmade resources, energy, and land have been growingly consumed is that the population growth has been increasing dramatically at a faster rate. According to the United Nation, there are more than seven billion sapiens in the world today. With the growing number of people, humans have released more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are gases that trap energy in the atmosphere and cause the weather to become warm. When the gases accumulate in the air, the climate changes which results in devastating effects to the ecosystem. </p>
            <p>During the last Ice Age, humans have been enjoying a stable climate since the Earth was formed. The Pleistocene Epoch was the first period that Homo Sapiens evolved. By the end of the Epoch, humans were found almost every part of the planet. At one point during the Ice Age, sheets of ice covered all of Antarctica, majority parts of Europe, North and South America, and small areas in Asia. Due to the rise of sea level, the composition of the atmosphere, changes in the position of the Earth in relation to the Sun, however, the glaciers advanced and retreated as they thawed and refroze. As time went by, more than a quarter of the large Ice Age animals, including woolly mammoths, giant bears, saber-toothed tiger died out. Over the course of extinction, scientists have debated for years that climate change and overhunting are the results of it.</p>
            <p>After all, human activities including deforestation, damming rivers, laying down tens of thousands of kilometers of railroad tracks and so on are moulded to fit the needs of Homo sapiens. Over the course of the year, we have been disturbing the ecological equilibrium of our planet in myriad new ways. Habitats, for example, are destroyed and species go extinct. Ecological turmoil might also endanger the survival of Homo sapiens. Rising sea levels, widespread pollution, iceberg melting can make the Earth less hospitable to our kind. In the future, we might see a spiralling race between human power and human-induced natural disasters. If we do not take actions, humankind will drive many species into extinction and might even annihilate itself. At the end of the day, they might cause a succession of unanticipated and dangerous effects.</p>
            <p>In many parts of the countries we know are facing a huge problem, which is drought. Drought is a period of dehydration especially when prolonged, causing immeasurable damage to crops. Based on Worldatlas, Ethiopia is the first country to experience drought. In some regions, poor harvests and insecurity have led to food instability and lack of food supply across the country. Roughly a million people as well as children below the age of five entail government and international intervention every year. Severe rainfall and flood, poverty, diseases worsen the situation. If we compare with Ethiopia, Sudan has approximately 2.8 million people who are affected by drought every year, which has a more surprising number than Ethiopia. </p>
            <p>Drought has drastically impacted myriads of countries in many ways that can harm the Earth at a rapid rate. Other impacts affect climate change includes rising sea levels, extreme weather, increasing global temperature and so on and so forth. A lot of evidence indicates that we are destroying the foundations of human prosperity in an orgy of reckless consumption. Based on a report in CNN, global wildlife populations have fallen by 60% in over four decades. Pollution, deforestation, climate change, and other man-made factors have been accelerating. Another news report in Newsweek mentioned that the world will be warming up by two degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This means that warmer winters and hotter summers will be taken place more often. </p>
            <p>Some people do not bother to act upon, others are panicking about how they can save the Earth. Rather than worry too much about emissions, it is necessary to take action in light of saving the planet. As part of the society, we have to reduce the use of plastic and bring our own reusable shopping bags when necessary. If this is done properly, animals in the ocean will not be suffered under threat and they can live longer. In some countries such as the United States, plastic straws are banned in most coffee companies. Seattle, for example, becomes the first city to ban plastic straws since 1st July. The reason why plastic has to be banned is that they are not biodegradable which means that they do not break down into compounds that can easily be used for other purposes. </p>
            <p>Recycling is the most vital solution to save the world. Plenty of countries such as America and the UK are recycling their waste every day to use items for new products. Recently, the ocean is filled up with piles of rubbish that can contaminate the sea and sea species. Instead of using disposable bottles, we can use recyclable bottles to refill our drinks. Saving energy is also a sustainable way to reduce energy consumption. This not only decreases the utility bills but also saving the planet as a whole.</p>
            <p>For this generation, it is the matter between actions and the words that come from our mouth. It is not uneasy to fight climate change. Humans should take their actions before it is too late. Recently, I read an article about the ozone layer in The Guardian. Allegedly, it will be recovered continuously from man-made damage and it is likely to heal fully by 2060 if humans work a little harder. </p>
            <p>To conclude, saving the world is not as hard as we think. If we keep up our work, we can save our planet as soon as possible.   </p>
